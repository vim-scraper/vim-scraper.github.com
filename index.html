      <h1>Vim Scripts</h1>
      <p>is no more</p>

          <p>This used to be a mirror of <a href='https://www.vim.org/scripts'>Vim's scripts</a> site on Github.</p>

          <p>
            It was created to allow early package managers
            (such as <a href='https://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles'>Vim Update Bundles</a>
            and <a href='https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim'>Vundle</a>)
            to install scripts straight from GitHub
            <a id='src' href='#dst'><sup>*</sup></a>.
          </p>

          <p>Now that most Vim scripts are developed on GitHub and installable straight
            from the source, I'm happy to say that there's no need for vim-scripts anymore.</p>

          <p>The code has been emptied out to compel users to switch to better sources.
            The repos remain so none of the work in pull requests is lost.</p>

          <p>The scraper code is preserved on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper/">vim-scraper</a>.</p>

          <p>Happy vimming!</p>
