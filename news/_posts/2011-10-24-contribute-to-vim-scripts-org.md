Hello Vimmers!

All of you probably know the great [vim-scripts.org] project that mirrors [all vim.org scripts on Github](http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html) making them [available as git repos](https://github.com/vim-scripts).

[Scott](https://github.com/bronson), the author of [vim-scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org) did a great job with implementing and running it (at his own expense btw).  Still it can be even better!

For obvious reasons Scott's open-source-hours are limited as well as [mine](http://github.com/gmarik).
Therefore in order to improve [vim-scripts.org] we're looking for those of you interested in contributing your expertise.

Here's general outline on what needs to be done:

1. new website [theme](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/9), logo, [favicon](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/10)
2. Jekyll fixes: [pagination](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/6), [news dupes](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/7)
3. Language improvements all over the site: [edit down](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues/2)
4. List of all [web-site UX/UI improvements](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper.github.com/issues)
5. [scraper bugfixes](https://github.com/vim-scraper/vim-scraper/issues), lots of them

Yeah, lots to be done!

In case you cannot contribute with your skills you can always donate to support the project.

Discussion is welcomed so make sure to leave your [comment].

Thanks all, let's make Vim ecosystem better!
